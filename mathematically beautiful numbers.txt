While playing a mental math game, you realize that the number k is mathematically beautiful.

You then realize that the number x can be mathematically beautiful if it is represented as a sum of a sequence where each element is a power of k and all the numbers in the sequence are different.

Task

Your task is to determine whether the number is mathematically beautiful.

Input format

The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases.
The next T lines contain x  and k   denoting the numbers.
Output Format

For each test case, output  "YES"  if  is "mathematically beautiful" and  "NO"  otherwise.

Constraints
T<=100
1<=x<=10^18
2<=k<=9

2
91 3
17 5

YES
NO

91= 3^0+3^2+3^4
